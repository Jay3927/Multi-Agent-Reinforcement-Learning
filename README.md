# Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
I have implemented several reinforcement learning algorithms using Python, including QL, SARSA, AC, DQN, DDQN, Duelling DQN, D3QN, as well as multiple MARL algorithms such as Nash-QL, Nash-DQN, Nash-D3QN, Hierarchical Nash-DQN, and so on.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve some goal. The agent receives rewards by the environment for each action it takes, which guides it toward the right strategy to maximize the total reward over time. Reinforcement learning is used in various applications such as game playing, robotics for control tasks, and in autonomous vehicles.
Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) combines reinforcement learning with deep learning. In this approach, deep neural networks—which can handle large-scale, high-dimensional problems—are used to approximate the traditional functions used in RL, such as value functions or policies. Deep RL has been successfully applied to complex problems like playing video games at a superhuman level, mastering the game of Go, and complex robotic manipulation.
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an extension of reinforcement learning which involves multiple agents within an environment. These agents may be cooperative, competitive, or have a mix of cooperative and competitive goals. Challenges in MARL include the non-stationarity of the environment (as each agent learns and changes its policy, the environment changes for the other agents), as well as issues of credit assignment (deciding which actions of which agents led to a certain outcome) and the exponential increase in the complexity of the policy space with each additional agent. MARL models are valuable for studying and automating systems where multiple entities must act and interact, such as in economics, traffic systems, or ecosystem management.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)
RL is about training agents to make a sequence of decisions. By interacting with their environment and receiving feedback through rewards, these agents learn to achieve a specific goal.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning leverages neural networks with many layers, known as deep neural networks, to model complex patterns in data. It's a powerful subset of machine learning that's behind many of the most impressive AI applications today. 

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
MARL considers multiple learning agents within the same environment, often working towards individual or collective goals. It's a fascinating area of study with numerous practical applications in system automation, traffic, economics, and more.
